Hope you are enjoying using it as much as I enjoy working on it. \n\(K.appName) is an open source application developped on my free time. It looks this nice thanks to my coleague Cláudia Conceição (portfolio: http://cconceicao.com/, twitter: https://twitter.com/claudiaconceic). It is built using Swift 2.2. \nYou can check the source code at \(K.appGithubRepository)\n\nYou can read the story behind this app here: https://medium.com/@nunogonalves/my-first-app-store-app-story-6c29e01e0306\n\n A shout to Vincent Daubry (https://twitter.com/vdaubry) for his work on http://github-awards.com which allowed me to add the API to his web app."
